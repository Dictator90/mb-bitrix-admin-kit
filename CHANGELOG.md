# Changelog

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Added index query extension hooks to CRUD resources: `indexSelect`, `indexFilter`, `indexOrder`, `indexRuntime`, `beforeIndexQueryParams`, `afterIndexRows`, and `mapIndexRow`.
- Added ORM runtime field support for grids, including pass-through support for Bitrix `ReferenceField` instances.
- Added computed grid/detail fields via `Field::computed()` without automatically selecting computed columns from ORM.
- Added `Field::displayUsing()` for grid/detail presentation callbacks.
- Added filter ORM application API through `applyToOrmFilter()`.
- Added `CallbackFilter` for fully custom ORM filter logic.
- Added filter operators for text, number, select, and date filters.
- Added tests for query select/filter/order/runtime assembly, computed columns, display callbacks, callback filters, empty values, and row mapping.

### Changed
- Grid ORM query building now merges index field select, default/index select, UI/default/index filters, UI/default/index order, runtime fields, pagination, and resource parameter hooks in a deterministic order while preserving v0.1.0 hooks.
- Grid rows are now post-processed through resource row hooks before computed/display values are assembled.
- Empty filter values skip ORM filtering while preserving meaningful values like `0`, `'0'`, and `false`.
